# Licensing & Code Origin

This repository is the public community-facing app-template. It is intended to be a sanitized, distributable example of how Atriva AI composes an Edge AI product.

## License for this repo

The license file at the repository root defines the license for this public repo. (See `LICENSE`.)

## Relationship to `atriva-ai` (internal)

- This app-template is a derived, public-facing snapshot of a work-in-progress Docker app in the private `atriva-ai` repository.
- Any proprietary modules, credentials, or enterprise-only infrastructure have been intentionally excluded.

## License compatibility & duplication

- **If code originates from `atriva-ai` that is solely copyrighted by Atriva AI**, it can be released under the license chosen for this public repo.
- **If third-party contributors or external code exist in `atriva-ai` under a specific license (e.g., MIT)**, we must preserve the original license obligations when we copy that code into the public repo.
- For simplicity, we recommend choosing a permissive license compatible with the source components. See `docs/licensing-decisions.md` for more.
